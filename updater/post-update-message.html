                 <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>&nbsp; <u>Here are just some of the <b>NEW</b> features that were added in this update:</u>
             </p>
             
             <ul>
                 <li>
                    Minor overhaul of manual mode, moving the controls to the control panel so that you can control the grill outputs directly
                    from the dashboard if you desire.  Buttons and PWM slider is responsive without reloading the page.  Improved manual mode instructions.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Added the ability to manually override outputs (igniter, auger, fan) on the default dashboard and on the flex touch display.  The user 
                    can enable this in the safety settings, and select the amount of seconds to override the controller during operation.  Use with caution 
                    as this can potentially leave the igniter on for extended periods of time.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Behind the scenes improvements including:
