                This release contains bug fixes and feature updates since the previous version.

                 <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>&nbsp; <u>Here are just some of the <b>NEW</b> features that were added in this update:</u>
             </p>
             
             <ul>
                 <li>
                     Changed the <a href="/wizard">Configuration Wizard</a> to improve platform selection.  Now you can select your PCB Board type (or Custom)
                     and configure the available settings.  The wizard will automatically assign the right GPIO pins as configured for that particular version
                     of the board.  This also removes any extraneous configuration options. 
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Added transient probe configuration types so that probes can be marked as transient(not always available).  This means that if probes/probe 
                     ports are not fixed (like in the case of the DS18B20 device), then the control script can return None type for the temperature.  This allows 
                     the dashboard to do things like hide the card in the case where this probe isn't present.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Behind the scenes improvements including:  
                     <ul>
                         <li>
                             Moved all platform/board/system settings into 'platform' in the settings.json.  This neatly group all of these settings in a single
                             place so that they are not spread out across the settings configuration.  
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             Combined the pifire.py and pifire_pwm.py modules into a raspberry_pi_all.py module, which supports both AC and DC Fan configurations 
                             with most flavors of the Raspberry Pi single board computer.  
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             Created a board configuration utility that will make specific system configurations easier to perform on different single board 
                             computers.  The installation, wizard and update utilities can use this tool to do board configuration as needed for enabling different
                             features of the platform. 
                         </li>
                     </ul>
                 </li>
             </ul>
